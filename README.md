# Rome-Clock

This wallpaper was my second experiment with Wallpaper Engine wallpapers. I wrote `romanNumeral.js` a long time ago as a challenge to myself to see how succinctly I could write code to render out Roman numerals, and I wanted to make use of it somehow, so I decided to use it to display the time and date.
